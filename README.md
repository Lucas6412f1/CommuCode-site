# 🌟 CommuCode: The Open-Source Development Platform

**CommuCode** is a community-driven, open-source platform dedicated to democratizing game development and hosting. Our goal is to create a secure, learning-focused environment where developers can easily build, share, and play simple games created by the community.

This project is built as a **Passion Project** with a focus on **learning** and **architectural best practices**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The project is currently in the initial **Interface Architecture** setup phase. We are focused on establishing the core HTML/CSS structure and the account management system.

### Prerequisites (Planned Stack)

The CommuCode platform is built on a robust, multi-language architecture to ensure speed and flexibility:

* **Core Engine:** Python (for the primary application logic and tooling).
* **Scripting:** Luau (for fast, safe, and user-facing game scripting).
* **Data Architecture:** SQL Database (for secure account management and data integrity).

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned phases for CommuCode's expansion. Phases will be executed sequentially, focusing on stability and security at each step.

### Phase I: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

* Implement the secure, basic website interface and login/registration pages.
* Establish the core **SQL Data Architecture** for accounts.
* Develop a basic, functional **in-browser demo game** to test the initial platform architecture.

### Phase II: Platform Core Development

* Finalize the **Hybrid Engine Architecture** (Python Core / Luau Scripting).
* Transition the game library/browser functionality from the website to a separate **Python Desktop Application**.
* Enable users to upload, share, and play their own **user-created games**.

### Phase III: Content and Events

* Implement server-side logic and scheduling for **seasonal events** (e.g., Christmas, Easter hunts) to engage the community.
* Introduce dynamic content management tools.

### Phase IV: Desktop Expansion

* Optimize the Python Desktop Application for stability and performance.
* Release the CommuCode application to **macOS** and **Linux** users.

### Phase V & VI: Mobile Development

* Develop the **mobile application framework** (cross-platform approach).
* Finalize optimization and release the mobile application to the **Android** store.
* Finalize optimization and release the mobile application to the **iOS** App Store.

## 🤝 Contributing

We are an open-source, learning-focused project! We welcome contributions from developers interested in:

* **Backend/Data Architecture:** Setting up the initial SQL schema.
* **Frontend Development:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the website and desktop app interface.
* **Engine Development:** Working with Python and Luau scripting integration.
